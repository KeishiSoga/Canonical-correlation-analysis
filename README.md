R Implementation of Canonical Correlation Analysis
Overview
This repository contains an implementation of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) using R.
Objectives

Implement Canonical Correlation Analysis in R
Deepen understanding of CCA through both theory and practice

Current Status and Future Challenges

Still in the process of learning the theoretical aspects of Canonical Correlation Analysis
Need to further understand Permutation tests
